Todos and thoughts: 

Do we also need to keep track of auth0 users in the DB so we can link comments to them - probably?

making browsing pubs quicker and cheaper - Can we use the googleMaps component to display basic pub info ON the map,
full details with comments can go into the full pub info section at the bottom 

do we like useContext or are we going with zustand again?

figure out all the potential security issues and API caps to avoid griefers ruining your life - also add profanity filtering

do we want to use vercel long term? fix the M2 mac being crap with docker & postgres images.

Fix the god aweful Pub-admin page - we need to be able to search easily through pubs comments and users..  and use pagination to avoid burning down vercels server rack
